# sung-portfolio-site
Welcome to my portfolio website! Thank you for taking the time to look around. My inspiration for this site was to try and mimic Samsung Canada's website as much as possible. Using NextJS, TailWind CSS, and Vercel to host, I try to keep this website up-to-date whenever possible.

I also try to use semantic commit messages for best practice and as my skills and portfolio improve, I hope to optimize what I've built more in the future.

Enjoy looking around and I look forward to hearing from you!

To do:
- extras section
- pages and routing for projects section
- make welcome section cards clickable
