# Sung Min Sim – Portfolio Website

Welcome to my portfolio website! Thank you for taking the time to look around. My inspiration for this site was to try and mimic Samsung Canada's website as much as possible. Using **Next.js**, **Tailwind CSS**, and deployed with **Vercel**, this project showcases my background, projects, and development experience.
